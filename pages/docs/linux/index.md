Not done!

## ARCH LINUX

## UBUNTU (Ubuntu-GNOME)

## RAWHIDE

Include Rawhide, but not Fedora. Fedora doesn't have strong sell points over Arch or Ubuntu for example.

## GENTOO

## openSUSE (Tumbleweed)


## Notes

Should we include openSUSE? Should we add based systems like Antergos or Sabayon? Antergos for example posses issues like lightDM

In any case we should keep the recommendations tight! We shouldn't list like everything!
